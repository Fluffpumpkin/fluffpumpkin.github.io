<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another project so soon after the first. Do I put out a 
project a day or something? No, unfortunately I can't do that, however since 
this is the start of this blog I figure I should put some of my recent projects 
here, even if they were made a little before this blog was. It's the easiest way 
to add more posts at the beginning like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's post is on a project I actually did with a friend 
of mine. The only title I have for it is Surreal because that's what it is. The 
goal of this project was to create surrealism animation in only 6 hours. If you 
have no experience with 3D software, that may seem like a lot of time. It is 
not. Especially when starting completely from scratch like my friend and I were. 
The rules were we couldn't bring anything in. No pre-existing models, no 
textures, everything must be made during the 6 hour period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step was identifying what exactly we were going 
to make. It had to be surreal, yes, but what exactly? We ended up using an image 
as a reference. I would credit the artist, but I don't know the artist. I was 
given this image from a teacher at one point and I was never told where he got 
it from. This is the image we used.</p>

<br>
Next was making all of the assets such as the textures, models, and environment. 
My job landed with the environment, textures, and the animation. My friend made 
the characters and the fish. The trees were a little tricky as they are tall and 
have all the curvy branches only at the top. Another difficulty is that the 
whole tree is in frame. That means the perspective is distorted which isn't 
exactly easy in 3D. The result of the environment is one that is unique for 
sure. Once that was done and the characters and fish were imported from the 
friend we had a beautiful still. A still, however, is not enough. We needed 
animation.</p>

First I animated the fish. This was a fairly simple task. All I needed to do was 
put them on a curve and have them follow it. The characters had to have life. 
Life is something that can be hard to emulate. As humans we can spot even the 
smallest imperfection. While I will admit the characters aren't perfect, they 
are full of life and energy, which is more than I can say for some people.<br>
<br>
We ended up finishing the whole thing including the rendering in around 5 hours, 
so much quicker than planned. The resulting animation has a peaceful yet surreal 
feel to it. Personally it is one of my favorite projects to have worked on and I 
hope you enjoy it as much as I do</p>
