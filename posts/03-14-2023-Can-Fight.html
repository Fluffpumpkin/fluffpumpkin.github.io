<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it can be best to get away from the usual tasks and just focus 
on something silly. Something to just free up your spirit and get you going for 
the next project. That's what today's project is. I also thought this would be a 
perfect way to show my project process in more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what exactly is this project? Well, it's quite the concept. I was 
tasked (by a friend) to make a fight scene between two soda cans in as little as 
4 hours. I don't typically just take requests from friends, but this one sounded 
fun. I picked the two sodas we all know and love, Bepis and Conke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing I started with were the models, specifically the soda 
cans. These cans were fairly simple, soda cans have a basic cylinder shape. The 
arms were quite fun to model. I tend to model with the subdivision modifier. 
This means I only need to model the low-poly and the software (Blender) will 
make it smooth. It isn't perfect, but I can always clean it up later. Lastly was 
the sword. Getting the shape right was a little tricky, but the end result it 
quite refined and polished.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second was the textures. I use what Blender calls &quot;texture nodes&quot;. These 
texture nodes are a sort of blocky way to make procedural textures. Procedural 
textures are textures with infinite resolution. No matter how far you zoom in, 
you will never see pixels. This can be very useful since that's the case in real 
life as well. For the soda can I used a mix of both. The label on the can is an 
image with pixels, but most labels are. The detail on the can and arms, such as 
the bumps, rust, and color variation are completely procedural. The sword has 
some layering lines and the handle has a basic wood texture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third step was the environment. I went with a fairly basic 
environment. The background is an image texture of a storefront with some 
reflection mapping and in the foreground is a vending machine and a cardboard 
box. The ground is an image texture of some grass that I gave a slight height 
mapping to. Nothing overly complicated, but a necessary part of any animation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The final step was the animation. This is my favorite step. I was a 
little pinched on time, so I didn't get all the animation quite how I would have 
liked, but I am over-all pleased with the result. The can's each have a bit of 
personality and each movement was thought out. Working on the animations is 
always the best part of any project. Creating life-like movent is what I strive 
for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really enjoyed working on this fun project. Working on big things all 
the time can get tiring and draining and this was just what I needed to get 
myself back into the swing of things. The full video will be below this and I 
hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it.<br>
