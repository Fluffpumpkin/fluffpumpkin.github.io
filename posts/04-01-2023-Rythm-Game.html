There were some specific&nbsp;parameters, such as three short sections (opening, level complete, credits) and there had to be scrolling. The rest was pretty much up to me. Well, me and a friend. This was another group project. I do that every once in a while as working as a team allows more to be done and more quality control. </span><span><span>Like my previous projects, we had 6 hours to work on this.</span></span><p></p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first thing we did was a storyboard. I don't have it with me, but story-boarding can be very helpful for planning out where everything will go and when, as well as dividing up the workload. My task, like usual, was the environment and some of the animations. The game theme we decided on was a rhythm game.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The environment was fun to make. For this project we went for a more synthwave aesthetic. To start I made the hills that get flatter as they approach the camera as well as the neon colored wire-frames. Next was some columns that follow the same motion and then a basic floor. Getting everything to shrink as it gets closer to the camera was difficult. For this I had to use Blender's built in geometry nodes. These allow for procedural, math based motion. I used the distance from the camera then added it to the height of the grid, plus some random noise. This gave some very nice rolling hills.</span></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjYChv-V_Snmk_eQf6bQMx_tkDygRqXaE50h5x9RT1JlC6ot7SkwLAIOsTVVuyIk7eqxk9Me5p-76T3tYx0jEjOdBLVsU2p3EqAFd27NqO7R0shRDLap3SYQl-viDeypnVVnqoSsIAYdj57yj1oJuR5KfdUcC8Wcg3GtSncSfEHgaamUGMseQpjDW7sw/s600/rolling.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="338" data-original-width="600" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjYChv-V_Snmk_eQf6bQMx_tkDygRqXaE50h5x9RT1JlC6ot7SkwLAIOsTVVuyIk7eqxk9Me5p-76T3tYx0jEjOdBLVsU2p3EqAFd27NqO7R0shRDLap3SYQl-viDeypnVVnqoSsIAYdj57yj1oJuR5KfdUcC8Wcg3GtSncSfEHgaamUGMseQpjDW7sw/s320/rolling.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next was some blocks. After all, it isn't a rhythm game without something to hit to the beat. These were fairly simple cubes with some slight bevel for detail. I also added a title, as that was a requirement. The one we chose was Sonic Stride. For the title I found a cool font I liked and gave it a neon sign effect. I even added some blinking to really sell it. The background of the scene is a fog with a purple to pink gradient.<p></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUujAer1QinZ8cenCOQwf1wG8MFH6DjXdBXFcRIkwyPaReQA68F3XvjvV1ObXsqNCNAnhesvyEVmML9TKWIBmg6IT7JBjZtioXvvBB67o728orR7H-HgvMcypuwbVAjVCrjmEMnJguFJc9FD1qzs8ZqxbhfsC2bik670bCPD2NRWs3bqeWrzUrifHeDw/s1125/Screenshot%202023-04-01%20164430.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="631" data-original-width="1125" height="179" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUujAer1QinZ8cenCOQwf1wG8MFH6DjXdBXFcRIkwyPaReQA68F3XvjvV1ObXsqNCNAnhesvyEVmML9TKWIBmg6IT7JBjZtioXvvBB67o728orR7H-HgvMcypuwbVAjVCrjmEMnJguFJc9FD1qzs8ZqxbhfsC2bik670bCPD2NRWs3bqeWrzUrifHeDw/s320/Screenshot%202023-04-01%20164430.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final steps were up to my teammate. She did the level complete scene and put the "credits" together. I put the word credits in quotes because those are fake names we made up for the project. None of those people actually worked on it. Lastly of all, I used a compositor to put all the scenes together and we got a final result I'm proud of. Like always, I hope you enjoy it as much I enjoyed making it.<br /><p></p><p><span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LcNBx-oZrA" width="460" youtube-src-id="7LcNBx-oZrA"></iframe></div><br /><p></p>
