<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now two posts in and only now do I realize I was 
never introduced. You know my work, but you haven't got a clue who I am. Allow 
me to help with that. Today's post is going to tell you who I am, my goal for 
this blog and my website, and what I hope to end up achieving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, let's start with addressing the simple question. 
What if you just want to see my qualifications and maybe a little summary? Well 
you're in luck. Right at the top of this page there's a button that says 
&quot;about&quot;. That will take you to a page with all that. But this post will be much 
more in depth than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's start at the very basics. My name is Amber. I own 
this blog as well as the website that you likely got here from (<a target="_top" href="https://www.fluffpumpkin.net/">fluffpumpkin.net</a>). 
I have a passion for all things 3D and I hope to find myself in a career doing 
it sometime soon. I was a student at Pima JTED, which has an excellent 3D 
animation course, and that is where I received most of my formal training as 
well as took the test for my After Effects certification. I am fluent in Python, 
C#, JavaScript, and HTML5. I would consider myself a fast learner and I am able 
to work well with tight deadlines, which I believe are two things that go hand 
in hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so now you know who I am, but you don't know the 
why. Not why I exist, because I don't want to go into that discussion, but 
rather why I am even doing 3D in the first place. Well, it actually started 
because in 8th grade I found Blender 3D, my software of choice for animation, 
and I got it to run on a Chromebook. That's how my journey started. I found out 
that I could create and breathe life into my creations. I could make worlds and 
characters that could never exist in reality. The real world can get dull at 
times, but worlds that can be created have endless possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My passion for 3D lies within a few more specific realms. 
I can make just about anything and I'm quite good at photo-realism, which is 
appreciated in the industry. What I enjoy, however, is creating stylized works. 
Photo-realism exists in the real world. That's where I am all the time. Why 
create more of it during my free time? If someone wanted me to model and animate 
a realistic shopping cart rolling down a realistic road, I would do it, but I 
would ask why. Why recreate what can be filmed when you can do so much more?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programs and software I use are the one's I'm familiar 
with, but I'm sure I could learn any given the need. For 3D animation I use 
Blender, a free, open-source program. I also do game design for which I use 
Unity, probably the most popular game engine. I use Adobe After Effects for 
video editing and effects and Photoshop for image editing. For any programming I 
do I use Visual Studio Code because of all the extensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, now for some miscellaneous facts. I am a big fan 
of Anime and my favorite is Spice and Wolf. In my free time I enjoy drawing and 
writing as well as the obvious, 3D animation. The best color is the color code
<font color="#FF73C2">#ff73c2</font>. And if I could have any superpower it 
would be shapeshifting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this blog post was informational and you got to 
know more about me and why I'm doing this. I will be trying to get out at least 
two posts a week, maybe more if I get the time, but it isn't very likely. This 
blog is a place to share my work, so there likely won't be any posts about my 
life or what I'm doing personally. This is for my projects and work, but I might 
post some life-related things on my twitter (<a target="_top" href="https://x.com/fluffestpumpkin">@fluffestpumpkin</a>).</p>
