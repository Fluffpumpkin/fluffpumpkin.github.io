You know my work, but you haven't got a clue who I am. Allow me to help with that. Today's post is going to tell you who I am, my goal for this blog and my website, and what I hope to end up achieving.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Okay, let's start with addressing the simple question. What if you just want to see my qualifications and maybe a little summary? Well you're in luck. Right at the top of this page there's a button that says "about". That will take you to a page with all that. But this post will be much more in depth than that.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's start at the very basics. My name is Fluffpumpkin. I own this blog as well as the website that you likely got here from (<a href="https://www.fluffpumpkin.net/" target="_blank">fluffpumpkin.net</a>). I have a passion for all things 3D and I hope to find myself in a career doing it sometime soon. I was a student at Pima JTED, which has an excellent 3D animation course, and that is where I received most of my formal training as well as took the test for my After Effects certification. I am fluent in Python, C#, JavaScript, and HTML5. I would consider myself a fast learner and I am able to work well with tight deadlines, which I believe are two things that go hand in hand.</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Okay, so now you know who I am, but you don't know the why. Not why I exist, because I don't want to go into that discussion, but rather why I am even doing 3D in the first place. Well, it actually started because in 8th grade I found Blender 3D, my software of choice for animation, and I got it to run on a Chromebook. That's how my journey started. I found out that I could create and breathe life into my creations. I could make worlds and characters that could never exist in reality. The real world can get dull at times, but worlds that can be created have endless possibilities.</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My passion for 3D lies within a few more specific realms. I can make just about anything and I'm quite good at photo-realism, which is appreciated in the industry. What I enjoy, however, is creating stylized works. Photo-realism exists in the real world. That's where I am all the time. Why create more of it during my free time? If someone wanted me to model and animate a realistic shopping cart rolling down a realistic road, I would do it, but I would ask why. Why recreate what can be filmed when you can do so much more?</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programs and software I use are the one's I'm familiar with, but I'm sure I could learn any given the need. For 3D animation I use Blender, a free, open-source</span> program. I also do game design for which I use Unity, probably the most popular game engine. I use Adobe After Effects for video editing and effects and Photoshop for image editing. For any programming I do I use Visual Studio Code because of all the extensions.<br /></span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alright, now for some miscellaneous facts. I am a big fan of Anime and my favorite is Spice and Wolf. In my free time I enjoy drawing and writing as well as the obvious, 3D animation. The best color is the color code <span style="color: #ff73c2;">#ff73c2</span></span><span>. And if I could have any superpower it would be shapeshifting.</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I hope this blog post was informational and you got to know more about me and why I'm doing this. I will be trying to get out at least two posts a week, maybe more if I get the time, but it isn't very likely. This blog is a place to share my work, so there likely won't be any posts about my life or what I'm doing personally. This is for my projects and work, but I might post some life-related things on my twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/fluffestpumpkin" target="_blank">@fluffestpumpkin</a>).<br /></span></p>
